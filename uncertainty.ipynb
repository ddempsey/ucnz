    "When using mathematical models to describe the real-world, we must contend with a staggering amount of **ignorance**<sup>1</sup>. Indeed, mathematical modelling as an activity is motivated by our own ignorance. Perhaps we are interested in the unknown value of some system parameter? Or maybe we harbour a general concern about the unpredictable future? Or, turning it around, if we already **know** the answer, what is the point of modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimizing** the effects of error and uncertainty, and articulating **quantitatively** that which remains, are nontrivial undertakings. Too often, these steps are neglected: a model prediction is made that, in the absence of any disclosure of uncertainty, is **implied to be perfect**. Vague caveats might sometimes be offered about the prediction's quality in the face of some model simplification or assumed parameter value. However, the greatest confidence is attained when model predictions are attached **probabilistic bounds**, e.g., \"*by 2024, the largest earthquake triggered by gas extraction operations has a 90% likelihood of lying in the interval [3.8, 4.6], with the most likely outcome being a M 4.2*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Error and uncertainty enter into the modelling process **at all stages**, for instance: \n",
    "- When a model is first developed and we are required to make **simplifying assumptions** (structural error).\n",
    "- When **imperfect or incomplete measurements** (observation error) are used to calibrate the model.\n",
    "- When the model is used to **make a prediction** of the future (prediction uncertainty), even though its parameters are **not completely constrained** (parameter uncertainty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because uncertainty can never be eliminated entirely, it is important that rigorous methods are developed to handle it. For this module, you will be assessed on your ability to, for a specific scenario, **identify** where significant uncertainty could arise and, where possible, **quantify** its impact on modelling outcomes.\n",

Unfortunately, when it comes to modelling, absolute certainty is in short supply. In fact, we saw in the previous section that, when observational error is allowed for, our best estimate, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_0$, is always going to be wrong to some degree, which means the prediction, $f(x_f;\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_0)$ **is always going to be wrong** as well.
